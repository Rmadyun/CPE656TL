This data collected from the Train Moving along the test track loop
on 2/17/2016 in the Positive Train Control Test Bed
In the UAH ECE Department Building.

Below is a Cross-Section of the Train Moving along the left
Figure 8 portion of the track.
The train is already in motion during this snapshot.
RFID Tags are spaced approximately 6 inches apart.

Interpolation for positions between RFID Tags is Linear.

Train was found to be moving at the initial position of 41.25, 22.5 
at about 8 inches per second.
This was calculated by calculating the distance between points and dividing it over the change in time. The average speed from E6->E7 and E7-> E8 was used to determine the speed.
A similar process was done for orientation. It is known that 
this section of track is where the train is arcing from E6->E7->E8->E9.

The angle between E6 and E7 was used to determine the average orientation of the train as it moves from E6->E7.
The average orientation of the train as it moves from E7->E8 was then calculated.
Since this is an arc, the truth of the orientation of the train as it moves
tangent to E7 is approximately the average to the pre and post orientations determined.

The angle is calculated using the following: atan2( (delta y) / (delta x))
This is consistent with the orientation calculations mentioned in the Train Trax SDD. See there for more details.

IMU Measurements from the start of the sampling where the train is at rest (50 samples worth) was prepended in front of the test case so that the
IMU calibration algorithm can complete prior to analyzing the test case.
